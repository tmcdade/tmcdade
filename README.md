- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Taurean McDade and im the crazy friend who stays up late reseraching new projects or ways to improve myself. I am a very passionate individual who loves to succeed in this thing we call everyday life. Whether its me sacrafising some nights or staying up later to learn something to make myself more productive or successful. I will always put that extra time and effort in. My grandma always told me anything is possible as long as you work hard for it. Im a huge Giants fan and love to travel the world as much as I can. I know the Giants are horrible now but YOU JUST WAIT
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m PROFICIENT in cloud security engineering mainly AWS with a sprinkle of azure and GCP. I am super passionate about cloud security and blockchain/crypto/web3 and donate a few hours every day to keep myself up to date with whatever is going on in those spaces. Currently further strengthening my knowledge within the cybersecurity space as well as teaching myself smart contract development/auditing, blockchain development and how to say secure in this new METAworld we are about to live in
